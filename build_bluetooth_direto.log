To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.5/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon in the Gradle documentation.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build 

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

   > Could not resolve project :hsm-android-print.
     Required by:
         project :app

          - None of the consumable configurations have attributes.
